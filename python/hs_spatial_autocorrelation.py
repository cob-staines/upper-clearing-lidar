# import dems

# subtract dems to get HS (or dHS)

# mask to ROI (ie. forest, clearing)

# pick n random xy points (p1)
# pick n random points (p2)

# calculate distance matrix p1-p2

# calculate dHS matrix HS(p1)-HS(p2)

# reshape matrices to vector

#drop points with prob ~ sqrt(distance) (for uniform sample)

# plot dist vs dHS

# look up semivariogram, silly!
